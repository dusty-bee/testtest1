# hi my name is olivia but I don't like that name
## because my instagram handle is @ [dusty.bee](https://www.instagram.com/dusty.bee/)  some of my friends call me bee
### (or dusty, but whatever).
I like painting and **bees** incase you haven't noticed.
I think that's because my family *owns* beehives
I also have ~~five~~ six cats
Their names are as follows:
1. Salem
``` this is a pic of me and salem together```

1. Ginger Snap
1. Balthazar
1. Celseius 
1. Momo
1. Gabriel

cats rule, okay?

``` but I also have a dog named Juno. She's stiny and you can't say the word Cheeseburger around her because she knows what it means and will not leave you alone until you give her one. ```

If you want to know what my sense of humor is like, here's a good example!


|         | **yee** | **haw** | **partner** |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **yee** | yeeyee  | yeehaw  | yee partner |
| **haw** | hawyee  | hawhaw  | haw partner |

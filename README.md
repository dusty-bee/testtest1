### (or dusty, but whatever).

I like painting and **bees** incase you haven't noticed.

I think that's because my family *owns* beehives

I also have ~~five~~ six cats

Their names are as follows:
1. Salem

``` he kind of looks like this ```

2. Ginger Snap
3. Balthazar
4. Celseius 
5. Momo
6. Gabriel

cats rule, okay?

> but I also have a dog named Juno. She's stiny and you can't say the word Cheeseburger around her because she knows what it means and will not leave you alone until you give her one.

If you want to know what my sense of humor is like, here's a good example!

|         | **yee** | **haw** | **partner** |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **yee** | yeeyee  | yeehaw  | yee partner |
| **haw** | hawyee  | hawhaw  | haw partner |

This is also one of my fav youtube videos, if u click on the pic it will take u to the vid!
